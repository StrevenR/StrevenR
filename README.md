My name is Streven if you'd like to discuss anything I have here please reach out to me. I love to talk methodology and find ways to streamline and improve!

 
I am currently working on the Google Data Analytics certification and many of the projects you see here are part of that. I have been the unofficial "data guy" on every team I've worked on and I'm now working on making that official. If you know anyone looking for someone in the role let me know!

I do have some fun projects in here as well. I'm an avid player of TTRPGs and love to make the games easier to access for people. Whether that's through character generators or applications/google sheets that actually help you keep track of and play your characters.

Everything has a ReadMe file that explains the scope and purpose of what I am working on so if you have questions you can look there or just send me a message.
